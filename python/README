# Reading Files
## Description
An application consisting of three parts: a REST API server written in Django using the Django REST Framework, a gRPC server, and a CLI application for working with them. The servers store files that can be accessed with get requests and receive either file metadata or the information stored in them.

## Stack technology
- Django
- DRF
- grpcio

## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/TheSaintDeer/Reading-Files.git`

## Run

- `python3 -m venv venv`
- `source env/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run REST API
REST API server is located in the API directory
- `cd app/`
- `python manage.py migrate`
- `python manage.py runserver`

### Run gRPC
gRPC server is located in the gRPC directory
- `python grpc_server.py `

### Run CLI application
